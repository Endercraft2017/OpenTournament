- [ ] Add proper tournament state management

**Deliverables**:

- Manual pairing generation control
- Clear tournament workflow with defined states
- Proper tournament lifecycle management

#### 4. Tiebreaker System Enhancement

**Objective**: Implement configurable tiebreaker system with user preferences

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Add tiebreaker configuration to preferences dialog
- [ ] Implement series tiebreaker with priority ordering
- [ ] Add tiebreaker computation button that appears conditionally
- [ ] Add tooltips with definitions for each tiebreaker
- [ ] Implement confirmation dialog before computing tiebreakers

**Deliverables**:

- Configurable tiebreaker selection
- Priority ordering for tiebreaker series
- Conditional tiebreaker computation button
- Informative tooltips with tiebreaker definitions

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Low Priority)

#### 5. Dual Database System

**Objective**: Implement current vs. permanent database system

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Design dual database architecture
- [ ] Implement current tournament database (temporary)
- [ ] Implement permanent database (persistent)
- [ ] Add tournament history viewer
- [ ] Implement tournament record deletion

**Deliverables**:

- Separation of current and historical tournament data
- Tournament history viewing capability
- Ability to delete historical tournament records

#### 6. Enhanced UI/UX Features

**Objective**: Improve user experience with additional controls and feedback

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Fix tab navigation after match submission
- [ ] Add settings tab for pairing system selection
- [ ] Implement CSV export on tournament end
- [ ] Add tournament ID system for better tracking

**Deliverables**:

- Consistent tab navigation behavior
- Easy pairing system selection
- Automated CSV export functionality
- Improved tournament identification and tracking

## Implementation Timeline
